    <p>I'm a budding developer, trying to get my grubby hands on all the knowledge available. I currently have html, css, and javascript under my belt. A coding dojo yellow belt, that is. I've got my eye set on that black belt in Python right now though. Keep a good look out for new projects coming soon!</p>
